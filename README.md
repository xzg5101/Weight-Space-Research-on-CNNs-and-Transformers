# Weight-Space-Research-on-CNNs-and-Transformers

This repository is to further expand the concept of symmetry in weight-space of neural networks from \citet{navon2023} to more architectures, namely CNN and Transformers. The objective is to construct a network by observing the property of the input networks, transform and manipulate the weight space, such that the constructed network mimics the function of input networks efficiently.
