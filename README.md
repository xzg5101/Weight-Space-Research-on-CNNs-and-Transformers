# Weight-Space-Research-on-CNNs-and-Transformers

This repository is to further expand the concept of symmetry in weight-space of neural networks from DWSNets to more architectures, namely CNN and Transformers. The objective is to construct a network by observing the property of the input networks, transform and manipulate the weight space, such that the constructed network mimics the function of input networks efficiently. 

The official implementation of DWSNet can be found here:
